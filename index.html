    <h1>Welcome to the 6Linux homepage!</h1>
    <p>6Linux is a lightweight, simple and easy to use Linux distribution using the Linux kernel version 6.7.4, BusyBox 1.36.1 and Microwindows. No offical version has been launched yet, but that will be in a couple days or so. When an official image is released, it will be in alpha, PLEASE DO NOT USE IT ON YOUR NORMAL MACHINE! Use it in a VM. There will be a download button that will take you to the download page when it launches.</p>
