    <h1>Welcome to the 6Linux guides!</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>To use 6Linux:</h2>
    <h3>1. Download the archive</h3>
    <p>Download the archive from the main web page.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>2. Extract the archive</h3>
    <p>Extract the newly downloaded archive with a tool like WinRAR or 7Zip.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>3. Run the QEMU VM</h3>
    <p>After extracting the archive, run this command in Command Prompt (in the extracted archive directory): "<qemu_install_dir>\qemu-system-x86_64.exe boot", where <qemu_install_dir> is the directory you installed QEMU in (normally, it is located in C:\Program Files\qemu\).</p>
    <p>After opening QEMU with the image, you will see that after "boot:" you will have to type something, type "/bzImage -initrd=/init.cpio", wait for a couple of seconds, and then press ENTER a couple times, and you are using 6Linux.</p>
